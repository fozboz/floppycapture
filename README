Ignore this for now, in progress

working on floppy capture to automate ingest:
basically, takes some args, takes a picture of the disk, runs appropriate kryoflux dtc commands, 
names and places fileswhere I want them, checks for success, updates metadata and logs, yadda yadda,
super environment-specific
